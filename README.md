# My first API (big lie)

Very interesting program that uses a
holy api which allows us to establish
a connection with the God himself

To try the holy program just lauch it

```shell
python main.py
```

The output is quite bulky so i suggest
you redirect it to a file or pipe it
to a pager to see the whole output.

```shell
python main.py >tmp
python main.py | less
```
